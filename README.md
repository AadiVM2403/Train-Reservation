# Train-Reservation

The project is a train seat reservation system designed to facilitate efficient booking for passengers. It features a single train coach with 80 seats, arranged in rows of 7, with the last row containing 3 seats. Users can reserve up to 7 seats at a time, prioritizing bookings within the same row. If row seats are unavailable, the system intelligently finds nearby available seats. The application is built using Angular, utilizing TypeScript for logic, HTML for structure, and CSS for styling. The user interface displays seat availability visually, allowing for easy interaction and seamless booking without the need for login credentials.
